        <p>STRATA (There Are Always Tracks to Follow) is an abstract representation of an excavation site based on previous archaeological digs near the site of the Harvard Indian College. It is a theoretical container of extracted earth, presented above the ground as a public activation that materializes the site’s history, its analysis, and mythologies. This fabric structure doubles as a screening location for indigenous-directed and featured films during the evening of the festival. Together, it is a counterpoint to the implicit mythologies of Harvard’s origin, an installation concerned with our present moment, and with layers of sediment yet to be deposited.</p>
